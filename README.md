### Running the Application Locally

You can run the application using PHP's built-in web server:

```bash
# Option 1: Listen on localhost only
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000

# Option 2: Listen on all network interfaces
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (for localhost access)
- `http://0.0.0.0:8000` (for network access)

### Environment Configuration

The application is configured via `config.php`. The default environment is set to **UAT** (User Acceptance Testing).

## Production Deployment

### Switching to Production Mode

To deploy to production:

1. Open `config.php`
2. Change line 12 from:
   ```php
   define('ENVIRONMENT', 'UAT'); // Options: 'UAT' or 'PROD'
   ```
   to:
   ```php
   define('ENVIRONMENT', 'PROD'); // Options: 'UAT' or 'PROD'
   ```

3. Save the file

### Production Domain

The production domain is configured as: **banknkonde.com**

### Deploying to Production Server

1. Upload all files to your production web server
2. Ensure `config.php` has `ENVIRONMENT` set to `'PROD'`
3. Configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to point to the root directory
4. Ensure the domain `banknkonde.com` is properly configured in your DNS
5. Set up SSL/HTTPS for secure connections

#### Apache Configuration Example

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName banknkonde.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/Bank-Nkhonde-Website
    
    <Directory /path/to/Bank-Nkhonde-Website>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Nginx Configuration Example

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name banknkonde.com;
    root /path/to/Bank-Nkhonde-Website;
    index index.html index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

## Firebase Configuration

- Authentication (Firebase Auth)
- Database (Firestore)
- File Storage (Firebase Storage)

Firebase configuration is located in `scripts/firebaseConfig.js`.
