# Bank Nkhonde - Digital ROSCA Management Platform

## What is Bank Nkhonde?

Bank Nkhonde is a comprehensive digital platform designed to modernize and simplify the management of ROSCAs (Rotating Savings and Credit Associations) - traditional community savings groups popular in Malawi and across Africa. Think of it as a complete financial management system built specifically for village banking groups, savings clubs, and community lending circles.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional ROSCA groups face several challenges:
- **Manual Record Keeping**: Paper ledgers are error-prone and can be lost
- **Lack of Transparency**: Members can't see real-time balances and payments
- **Payment Tracking Issues**: Difficult to track who paid, when, and how much
- **Loan Management Complexity**: Calculating interest, penalties, and repayment schedules manually is tedious
- **Communication Gaps**: Hard to notify all members about meetings, payments, or updates
- **Limited Accountability**: No audit trail when disputes arise

## Example Use Case

**Scenario: Women's Savings Club**

**Group Setup:**
- Name: "Unity Women's Club"
- Members: 12 women from the same village
- Monthly Contribution: MWK 50,000
- Seed Money: MWK 10,000 (one-time)
- Cycle: 11 months
- Contribution Due: 15th of each month

**How They Use Bank Nkhonde:**

1. **Admin (Chairlady) creates the group** on Bank Nkhonde, sets the rules above, and invites all 12 members via WhatsApp.

2. **Each member joins**, completes their profile, and immediately sees:
   - Their outstanding seed money (MWK 10,000)
   - First monthly contribution due on January 15th
   - The group's rules and payment calendar

3. **Member makes payment**: Grace pays MWK 10,000 seed money via mobile money. She uploads a screenshot through Bank Nkhonde. Admin approves it. Grace's dashboard updates instantly.

4. **Member requests a loan**: In Month 3, Mercy needs MWK 200,000 for school fees. She submits a loan request. Admin reviews her payment history (all up-to-date), approves the loan, and records disbursement. Mercy sees her repayment schedule immediately.

5. **Admin tracks everything**: The chairlady can see at a glance:
   - Total collected: MWK 1,620,000
   - Active loans: 4 (with individual balances)
   - Arrears: 2 members behind by MWK 50,000 each
   - Next cycle payout projection

6. **Reporting**: At the end of the cycle, admin exports a complete financial report showing all contributions, loans, interest earned, and final distributions.
